REWOP is an Italian brand of sunglasses that are entirely handmade in Italy, with the use of the highest quality materials.

## The challenge

Rewop is an anagram of "power", and reflects the strength, freshness and dynamicity that characterize the brand. It was imperative that we designed a website that respect these values while being fast and easy to navigate.

## A new mobile experience

The theme we worked on was carefully chosen to provide a sleek mobile experience, and we made sure that everything was just as good as the desktop experience.

## A brand new store locator

REWOP operates also offline through a global network of resellers. As such they wanted to promote their offline business through their website, in order to help potential customers to locate nearby stores. To help them achieve this goal we crafted a whole new store locator experience.

## Website performances

With their old e-commerce REWOP was suffering from slow page load times, as pages took more than 10 seconds to load. With their new Shopify we saw a 3x page speed improvements that immediately led to an increase of sales.

## The results

A unique look and feel that convey REWOP brand values and highlights unique look of their "Made in Italy" sunglasses. A new Shopify site that loads fast and simplifies the path for growth.
