REWOP is an Italian brand of sunglasses that are entirely handmade in Italy, with the use of the highest quality materials.

## The challenge

Rewop is an anagram of "power", and reflects the strength, freshness and dynamicity that characterize the brand. It was imperative whilst modernising their eâ€‘commerce that we designed a website that respect these values.

We went through a brainstorming phase during which we proposed mockups and discussed with them until we reached the final result. 

## A brand new store locator

REWOP operates also offline through a global network of resellers. As such they wanted to promote their offline business through their website, in order to help potential customers to locate nearby stores. To help them achieve this goal we crafted a whole new store locator experience.

## Website performances

With their old e-commerce REWOP was sufferring from slow page load times, as pages took more than 10 seconds to load. With their new Shopify we saw a 3x page speed improvements that immediately led to an increase of sales.

## The results

A unique look and feel that convey REWOP brand values and highlights .
