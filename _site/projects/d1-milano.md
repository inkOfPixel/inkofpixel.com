D1 Milano is a luxury fashion accessory brand born in Milan during the 2013 Edition of Milano Fashion Week. The company is considered one of the fastest growing brands in the luxury industry and has been featured by Forbes in the list of Top 10 Startups Redefining Italian Fashion.

In 2016 we first met the head of D1 Milano and discussed about how to build an amazing online shopping experience. During our first meetings we identified the structure of the website in order to clearly organize the content and be able to highlight their products as well as promoting their brand. We also identified the unique features that they need, such as a store locator to allow their customer to locate their offline presence around the world and a "lifestyle" page with their Instagram feed. We then worked closely with them to find the best UI for their website, iterating over mockups until we all were satisfied.

Beside building the e-commerce platform we also took care of configuring the integration with their logistic in order to streamline the workflow to fulfill orders.

We are now continuously working with D1 Milano team to improve their workflow even further and help them obtain the best performance from their e-commerce.
