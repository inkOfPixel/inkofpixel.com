## Working together

D1 Milano approached us to discuss about how to build an amazing online shopping experience. We  identified the unique features that they need, such as a store locator to allow their customer to locate their offline presence around the world and a "lifestyle" page with their Instagram feed. Closely working with them made it easy to outline the road for a successful e-commerce. We lended our extensive e-commerce knowledge to help them find the best experience for their website.

We built a custom Shopify app to better integrate with their logistic in order to streamline the workflow to fulfill orders. We also setup social sales channel (Facebook, Instagram) and other online channels like [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/).
