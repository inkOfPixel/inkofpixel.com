## Working together

D1 Milano approached us to discuss about how to build an amazing online shopping experience. We  identified the unique features that they need, such as a store locator to allow their customer to locate their offline presence around the world and a "lifestyle" page with their Instagram feed. Closely working with them made it easy to outline the road for a successful e-commerce. We lended our extensive e-commerce knowledge to help them find the best experience for their website.

## Integrations

We built a custom Shopify app to better integrate with their logistic in order to streamline the workflow to fulfill orders. We also setup social sales channel (Facebook, Instagram) and other online channels like [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/).

## Limited edition product pages

We helped D1 Milano launching the project shadow watch by designing and building an outstanding product page. The page included a count-down to create hype before product launch and a password protection to allow only user with a special code obtained through a newsletter subscription to buy the product.
