## Moving away from Magento

STIMM needed a platform that help them transform and grow toward a true multichannel business. We proposed Shopify to satisfy both their offline and online needs, as Shopify offers also a POS solution for offline sales. The first step was to move away from their old Magento website which was slow, difficult to navigate and expensive to keep up.
