      This year Shopify Unite (the annual Shopify partner and developer
      conference), there was a talk dedicated to headless commerce, which has
      generated a lot of interest. We want to take this opportunity to give our
      insight on the topic.

      ## What is a headless commerce and why does it matter


      To put it as simple as possible 


      > A headless commerce is an e-commerce where the front-end (the head, e.g.
      the website) is decoupled from the backend infrastructure (e.g. Shopify).


      This is a clear breaking point from the traditional approach where
      frontend and backend are instead tightly coupled in a monolith.\

      Even if this new architecture seems like a small change, it leads to a
      cascade of consequences that, if exploited in the right way, can
      dramatically improve every aspect of your e-commerce, from the development
      process to the final user experience.


      In this article we are going to discuss some of the advantages we have
      experienced by going headless and at the end we will discuss a case study
      to give a concrete feedback on the concepts we have presented.


      ## Flexibility and technology lead


      The monolithic structure of traditional commerce systems carries some
      shortcomings that cause chronic inability to keep up with the newest
      technologies. This leads to a number of constraints that limit the freedom
      of developers and slow down the overall business process.\

      Technology moves extremely fast and by choosing to go headless developers
      regain the complete control over the digital storefront with the freedom
      to choose the best technology available for each use case.


      > Having the possibility to choose technologies translates into a
      competitive advantage that eventually will give you a technology lead over
      your competitors.


      This technology lead means a faster development cycle where it’s easier to
      test new features, remove old ones and experiments with changes, with a
      shorter delay from concept to market. Going to market faster means that
      you will be offering new features and improvements before your
      competitors.\

      This situation gives us the agility required to quickly adapt to the new
      users behaviour and market trends.\

      Otherwise if we are constantly slowed down by the technology debt we will
      steadily lagging behind the competition.


      > Technology leads means that you can move faster than your competitors


      ### An example: Native mobile experience with Progressive Web Apps


      It’s quite common that mobile users generates a fair amount of traffic on
      an e-commerce. It’s however quite common that they have an experience that
      is far from being as pleasant as on desktop, or native application. Slow
      navigation and not optimized UX are some of the worst possible scenario
      for mobile users.


      > Giving mobile users the best possible experience should be a top
      priority of every e-commerce


      Developing a native mobile app is not something that every business can
      afford. But luckily a native application is not always necessary to give
      users a native experience. By using a headless solution is possible to
      transform the entire e-commerce in a Progressive Web App (PWA).\

      Progressive Web Apps is a new technology that allows to transform a webapp
      to provide a native app like experiences for the users. They work just
      like native apps but they drastically reduce the cost for a native user
      experience.\

      PWAs usually produce a higher user engagement and conversions which is the
      reason why many e-commerce are adopting this technology to grow their
      businesses.


      ## Customization and improved UX


      The limited flexibility of the traditional commerce greatly reduce the
      design choices available.


      > Not customizing your commerce to follow user behaviour is one of the
      critical problems that can directly affect the conversion.


      If you want your e-commerce to stand above your competitors you must
      associate your brand with a unique and remarkable experience. This means
      understanding how your users behave and build UX around this knowledge,
      instead of forcing the users to follow a standard design. 


      > To be effective, the UX should be customer-centered, tailored on the
      customer behavior, not the opposite.


      Headless gives you complete control over the user experience with endless
      customization possibility to build a user experience from scratch free
      from any constraints.


      ## What about speed and SEO?


      > A headless solution is faster, always.


      If someone has experience the opposite than he is not doing it right. A
      faster website means a better SEO score.\

      But most importantly page speed directly affects conversion. If your users
      have to wait a couple of seconds every time they change page or view a new
      product, there is a good chance that they will leave the e-commerce
      sooner.


      ### Don't test users' patience


      In 2016 Amazon released one of the first studies about the correlation
      between site speed and conversion rate. They showed that for every
      100-millisecond delay in page load lead to a 1% loss in sales.


      > A fluid and responsive experience improves the conversion rates


      ## Should my e-commerce upgrade to a headless solution?


      As always it depends. There are a lot of factors to consider before
      deciding to embrace a headless solution. First of all the budget.
      Rewriting your entire frontend can be quite costly and you must be sure
      that your business will benefit from it. You should make a precise
      analysis of the problems your e-commerce is having and if some of the
      problems are: 


      * a slow website

      * a non optimal user experience, particularly for mobile user

      * having the feeling of lagging behind competitors

      * An overall slowness to release new features or change existing ones.


      than headless can be a good investment for your business. If your
      e-commerce does not have users in the first place then there are probably
      more deep problems to fix before considering the change.


      > If you are starting a new e-commerce from scratch we strongly suggest to
      consider a headless solution.


      ## Why we decided to invest in headless


      At InkOfPixel we firmly believe that headless commerce will play an
      important role in the future of e-commerce and we have decided to fully
      embrace it. The main reason is that 


      > Headless gives an overall better experience both for the users and the
      developers


      ## Case study: Rue Des Mille


      Rue Des Mille is an Italian brand of prêt-à-porter jewelry. We dealt with
      the renewal of their e-commerce adopting a headless solution. We have
      rebuilt the website from scratch, using a third-party CMS, in combination
      with Shopify Plus, that powers our custom made front-end

      The first thing you notice about the commerce is that it’s extremely fast.
      Load time between pages is almost non existent

      ### PWA optimized


      As we said before, one of the advantages of using a custom made front end
      is the possibility to quickly adopt new technologies. For example this
      e-commerce is also a PWA, greatly improving the mobile experience.
