      # Shopify vs Magento: our take


      Magento and Shopify are two of the most popular platforms that can be used
      today to build an e-commerce. The debate between the flexibility offered
      by Magento versus the neatless offered by Shopify has not a clear winner
      yet.


      Many Shopify vs Magento posts have been written, and we are not going into
      details comparing every single feature, since you can likely find 10+
      pages articles online.


      We are going to approach this analysis using a more empirical method,
      sharing our experience having worked with both platforms and explaining
      why we have eventually decided to go all in on Shopify. 


      ## TLDR;


      Both Magento and Shopify will almost surely get you where you want.


      Magento is an open source solution, while Shopify it’s a Platform as a
      Service. You can customize Magento as you wish, adding or removing
      functionalities. Shopify, on the other hand, does not provide that
      flexibility, but it provides an ecosystem where you won’t miss much of
      Magento freedom.


      Flexibility comes at a cost in terms of complexity, and complexity is the
      main reason for longer development time and greater costs. The price of
      the freedom offered by Magento comes at the cost of having to manage every
      aspect of the e-commerce from hosting to security patches and updates.


      It’s not always worth to trade simplicity for flexibility, especially for
      businesses where moving fast is key for success.


      Headless commerce let’s you take responsibility over all the aspects of
      your e-commerce to achieve greater flexibility within Shopify.


      ## An overview of Magento and Shopify in 175 words.


      **Magento** was first released in 2008. In 2018 it was acquired by Adobe
      for $1.7bn. It is currently reported to be the n.1 e-commerce platform by
      volume handled.


      Magento offers two variants of its core product. The base product, Magento
      Open Source, is a free and open-source version of Magento where it’s
      possible to customize and extend its functionality; Their flagship Magento
      Commerce, targeted to enterprise, is a paid version that provide more
      features and can be run on-premises or as a PaaS, managed by Magento team
      with a solution they call Magento Hosted Cloud.


      **Shopify** was launched in 2006. In 2015 went public and it currently has
      a market cap of $35bn. It’s the third e-commerce by volume behind Magento
      and WooCommerce but it’s growing faster, particularly at enterprise level.
      It offers two solutions: Shopify, the base product that comes with
      different subscription plans, and Shopify Plus, which offers a higher
      level of customization and its targeted to enterprise. Both solutions are
      provided only in the form of a platform as a service (PaaS).
