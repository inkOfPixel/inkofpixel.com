      # Shopify vs Magento: our take


      Magento and Shopify are two of the most popular platforms that can be used
      today to build an e-commerce. The debate between the flexibility offered
      by Magento versus the neatless offered by Shopify has not a clear winner
      yet.


      Many Shopify vs Magento posts have been written, and we are not going into
      details comparing every single feature, since you can likely find 10+
      pages articles online.


      We are going to approach this analysis using a more empirical method,
      sharing our experience having worked with both platforms and explaining
      why we have eventually decided to go all in on Shopify. 


      ## TLDR;


      Both Magento and Shopify will almost surely get you where you want.


      Magento is an open source solution, while Shopify it’s a Platform as a
      Service. You can customize Magento as you wish, adding or removing
      functionalities. Shopify, on the other hand, does not provide that
      flexibility, but it provides an ecosystem where you won’t miss much of
      Magento freedom.


      Flexibility comes at a cost in terms of complexity, and complexity is the
      main reason for longer development time and greater costs. The price of
      the freedom offered by Magento comes at the cost of having to manage every
      aspect of the e-commerce from hosting to security patches and updates.


      It’s not always worth to trade simplicity for flexibility, especially for
      businesses where moving fast is key for success.


      Headless commerce let’s you take responsibility over all the aspects of
      your e-commerce to achieve greater flexibility within Shopify.


      ## An overview of Magento and Shopify in 175 words.


      **Magento** was first released in 2008. In 2018 it was acquired by Adobe
      for $1.7bn. It is currently reported to be the n.1 e-commerce platform by
      volume handled.


      Magento offers two variants of its core product. The base product, Magento
      Open Source, is a free and open-source version of Magento where it’s
      possible to customize and extend its functionality; Their flagship Magento
      Commerce, targeted to enterprise, is a paid version that provide more
      features and can be run on-premises or as a PaaS, managed by Magento team
      with a solution they call Magento Hosted Cloud.


      **Shopify** was launched in 2006. In 2015 went public and it currently has
      a market cap of $35bn. It’s the third e-commerce by volume behind Magento
      and WooCommerce but it’s growing faster, particularly at enterprise level.
      It offers two solutions: Shopify, the base product that comes with
      different subscription plans, and Shopify Plus, which offers a higher
      level of customization and its targeted to enterprise. Both solutions are
      provided only in the form of a platform as a service (PaaS).


      ## How to make a fair comparison?


      A 100% fair comparison is impossible. A more or less fair comparison can
      be:


      * Shopify vs Magento Open Source

      * Magento Commerce vs Shopify Plus.


      ## Who uses Shopify?


      In February 2019, it was reported that more than 800,000 merchants were
      using a Shopify platform. Some of the famous brand are:


      * [Lakers](https://lakersstore.com/)

      * [MVMT](https://www.mvmtwatches.com/)

      * [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/)

      * [Kyle cosmetics](https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/)

      * [Hawkers](https://www.hawkers.co/)

      ### Fun fact


      Elon musk’s Boring Company sold 20.000 flamethrower in a day using a shop
      powered by Shopify.

      ## Who uses Magento?


      Magento is used by more than 250,00 e-commerce. Some of the most famous
      brand are:


      * [Bulk Powders](https://www.bulkpowders.co.uk/)

      * [Helly Hansen](https://www.hellyhansen.com)

      * [Coca Cola](https://www.cokestore.com/)

      ## Flexibility/complexity tradeoff.


      Both Magento and Shopify provide all the features needed to handle the
      most common e-commerce use cases, like managing products, promotions,
      shippings, payments ecc.


      > There is a 99% chance that you can build any e-commerce with both
      platforms. The difference lies in the effort required to reach your goal
      and the overall user experience.


      Magento and Shopify have two completely different philosophies: Magento
      aims to offer a platform as customizable as possible, leaving the final
      choice about functionalities to developers, while Shopify aims to provide
      the easiest possible experience for merchants, with sensible defaults and
      tips on how to obtain higher performance from the e-commerce.


      > No platform is intrinsically better than the other but it’s all about
      which one fits your requirements in the best way.


      Before making any choice you need to carefully ask the following
      questions:


      * Do you prefer a self managed or PaaS solution?

      * If you choose a self managed solution, does your team have the technical
      knowledge required to build and manage the e-commerce?

      * What is your budget?

      * What functionality do you absolutely need and what are cool to have?


      If you end up deciding for the flexibility offered by Magento you should
      know that 


      > Flexibility comes at a cost.


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:|src:/assets/complexity-flexibility-tradeoff.png|alt:Complexity-Flexibility
      tradeoff)end-custom-image


      The flexibility you gain by using a platform like Magento come at a cost
      in the form of complexity, and you should ask if it is worth it.


      > Do you really need that extra flexibility?


      Flexibility gives you more freedom at the cost of increasing overall
      complexity. But there is a catch: the initial feeling of freedom given by
      having control over every functionality is shortly after replaced by the
      realization to be stuck again by overwhelming complexity.


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:|src:/assets/imfree.gif|alt:Freedom)end-custom-image


      ### The hidden costs of flexibility.


      Shopify PaaS model does not let you access or modify its source code and
      If you like the idea of having complete control over your application you
      will probably lean towards Magento.


      By using an open source solution like Magento you can add, remove or
      change every feature to create a product completely tailored on your
      needs. But you will also be responsible for every aspect of the
      e-commerce.


      > with great power comes great responsibility.


      _I’m ok with that, how hard can it be?_


      _It’s pretty hard._


      _Oh, but at least it’s free._


      _Weeeeeell, not exactly._


      If you decide to go for Magento Open Source hoping to save some money you
      will be pretty disappointed, since it’s true that you won’t be charged a
      penny by Magento but there are a lot of hidden costs that people tend to
      underestimate.


      > It’s very uncommon to take into account the opportunity cost when
      deciding between possible solutions.


      In this specific case the opportunity cost can be summarized with:


      > What could I have done instead of doing that?


      ### You need good technical skills just to build the e-commerce


      Magento is a huge project and the learning curve is quite steep. You need
      good programming skills just to dig into the code and make everything
      work. If you’re a non-technical person you will probably end up recruiting
      a developer team to handle the task.


      With Shopify you can publish a new e-commerce immediately, even if you
      don’t have any technical knowledge.


      If you want to go online quickly Shopify is the right choice


      ### Self Hosting


      Once you have finished building the e-commerce it’s time to host it, and
      here things start to get tricky. Self hosting means taking your website
      and making it accessible to the public by hosting it on some hosting
      provider like AWS. The server must be able to stand all the traffic while
      ensuring no data loss or inconsistencies. This is much more complex than
      what it seems like.


      start-custom-image(size:medium|align:center|width:undefined|src:/assets/hidden-cost.png|alt:Hidden
      cost of self hosting)end-custom-image


      Building an infrastructure from scratch means you have to deal with
      security, auto scale, load balance, database backups and much more.


      > Self hosting works great until it doesn’t


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:undefined|src:/assets/self-hosting.gif|alt:Self
      hosting)end-custom-image


      Shopify on the other hand is a fully hosted solution. That means that it
      runs on an infrastructure entirely managed by Shopify, and you don’t have
      to worry about anything.


      ### Security

      If you are going to sell anything online, you must follow specific
      security standard (namely PCI DSS) to protect your customer payment data
      from being stolen and used in fraud. The reputation of your store is at
      stake. Are your servers compliant with all those security standards? Do
      you meet GDPR requirements if you are selling in EU?
