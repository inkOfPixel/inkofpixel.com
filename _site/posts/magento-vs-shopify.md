      # Shopify vs Magento: our take


      Magento and Shopify are two of the most popular platforms that can be used
      today to build an e-commerce. The debate between the flexibility offered
      by Magento versus the neatless offered by Shopify has not a clear winner
      yet.


      Many Shopify vs Magento posts have been written, and we are not going into
      details comparing every single feature, since you can likely find 10+
      pages articles online.


      We are going to approach this analysis using a more empirical method,
      sharing our experience having worked with both platforms and explaining
      why we have eventually decided to go all in on Shopify. 


      ## TLDR;


      Both Magento and Shopify will almost surely get you where you want.


      Magento is an open source solution, while Shopify it’s a Platform as a
      Service. You can customize Magento as you wish, adding or removing
      functionalities. Shopify, on the other hand, does not provide that
      flexibility, but it provides an ecosystem where you won’t miss much of
      Magento freedom.


      Flexibility comes at a cost in terms of complexity, and complexity is the
      main reason for longer development time and greater costs. The price of
      the freedom offered by Magento comes at the cost of having to manage every
      aspect of the e-commerce from hosting to security patches and updates.


      It’s not always worth to trade simplicity for flexibility, especially for
      businesses where moving fast is key for success.


      Headless commerce let’s you take responsibility over all the aspects of
      your e-commerce to achieve greater flexibility within Shopify.


      ## An overview of Magento and Shopify in 175 words.


      **Magento** was first released in 2008. In 2018 it was acquired by Adobe
      for $1.7bn. It is currently reported to be the n.1 e-commerce platform by
      volume handled.


      Magento offers two variants of its core product. The base product, Magento
      Open Source, is a free and open-source version of Magento where it’s
      possible to customize and extend its functionality; Their flagship Magento
      Commerce, targeted to enterprise, is a paid version that provide more
      features and can be run on-premises or as a PaaS, managed by Magento team
      with a solution they call Magento Hosted Cloud.


      **Shopify** was launched in 2006. In 2015 went public and it currently has
      a market cap of $35bn. It’s the third e-commerce by volume behind Magento
      and WooCommerce but it’s growing faster, particularly at enterprise level.
      It offers two solutions: Shopify, the base product that comes with
      different subscription plans, and Shopify Plus, which offers a higher
      level of customization and its targeted to enterprise. Both solutions are
      provided only in the form of a platform as a service (PaaS).


      ## How to make a fair comparison?


      A 100% fair comparison is impossible. A more or less fair comparison can
      be:


      * Shopify vs Magento Open Source

      * Magento Commerce vs Shopify Plus.


      ## Who uses Shopify?


      In February 2019, it was reported that more than 800,000 merchants were
      using a Shopify platform. Some of the famous brand are:


      * [Lakers](https://lakersstore.com/)

      * [MVMT](https://www.mvmtwatches.com/)

      * [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/)

      * [Kyle cosmetics](https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/)

      * [Hawkers](https://www.hawkers.co/)

      *
      [Nestle](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/how-nestle-is-using-shopify-plus-to-target-millennials-by-making-adulthood-suck-less)

      ### Fun fact


      Elon musk’s Boring Company sold 20.000 flamethrower in a day using a shop
      powered by Shopify.

      ## Who uses Magento?


      Magento is used by more than 250,00 e-commerce. Some of the most famous
      brand are:


      * [Bulk Powders](https://www.bulkpowders.co.uk/)

      * [Helly Hansen](https://www.hellyhansen.com)

      * [Coca Cola](https://www.cokestore.com/)

      ## Flexibility/complexity tradeoff.


      Both Magento and Shopify provide all the features needed to handle the
      most common e-commerce use cases, like managing products, promotions,
      shippings, payments ecc.


      > There is a 99% chance that you can build any e-commerce with both
      platforms. The difference lies in the effort required to reach your goal
      and the overall user experience.


      Magento and Shopify have two completely different philosophies: Magento
      aims to offer a platform as customizable as possible, leaving the final
      choice about functionalities to developers, while Shopify aims to provide
      the easiest possible experience for merchants, with sensible defaults and
      tips on how to obtain higher performance from the e-commerce.


      > No platform is intrinsically better than the other but it’s all about
      which one fits your requirements in the best way.


      Before making any choice you need to carefully ask the following
      questions:


      * Do you prefer a self managed or PaaS solution?

      * If you choose a self managed solution, does your team have the technical
      knowledge required to build and manage the e-commerce?

      * What is your budget?

      * What functionality do you absolutely need and what are cool to have?


      If you end up deciding for the flexibility offered by Magento you should
      know that 


      > Flexibility comes at a cost.


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:|src:/assets/complexity-flexibility-tradeoff.png|alt:Complexity-Flexibility
      tradeoff|description:)end-custom-image


      The flexibility you gain by using a platform like Magento come at a cost
      in the form of complexity, and you should ask if it is worth it.


      > Do you really need that extra flexibility?


      Flexibility gives you more freedom at the cost of increasing overall
      complexity. But there is a catch: the initial feeling of freedom given by
      having control over every functionality is shortly after replaced by the
      realization to be stuck again by overwhelming complexity.


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:|src:/assets/imfree.gif|alt:Freedom|description:)end-custom-image


      ### The hidden costs of flexibility.


      Shopify PaaS model does not let you access or modify its source code and
      If you like the idea of having complete control over your application you
      will probably lean towards Magento.


      By using an open source solution like Magento you can add, remove or
      change every feature to create a product completely tailored on your
      needs. But you will also be responsible for every aspect of the
      e-commerce.


      > with great power comes great responsibility.


      _I’m ok with that, how hard can it be?_


      _It’s pretty hard._


      _Oh, but at least it’s free._


      _Weeeeeell, not exactly._


      If you decide to go for Magento Open Source hoping to save some money you
      will be pretty disappointed, since it’s true that you won’t be charged a
      penny by Magento but there are a lot of hidden costs that people tend to
      underestimate.


      > It’s very uncommon to take into account the opportunity cost when
      deciding between possible solutions.


      In this specific case the opportunity cost can be summarized with:


      > What could I have done instead of doing that?


      ### You need good technical skills just to build the e-commerce


      Magento is a huge project and the learning curve is quite steep. You need
      good programming skills just to dig into the code and make everything
      work. If you’re a non-technical person you will probably end up recruiting
      a developer team to handle the task.


      With Shopify you can publish a new e-commerce immediately, even if you
      don’t have any technical knowledge.


      If you want to go online quickly Shopify is the right choice


      ### Self Hosting


      Once you have finished building the e-commerce it’s time to host it, and
      here things start to get tricky. Self hosting means taking your website
      and making it accessible to the public by hosting it on some hosting
      provider like AWS. The server must be able to stand all the traffic while
      ensuring no data loss or inconsistencies. This is much more complex than
      what it seems like.


      start-custom-image(size:medium|align:center|width:|src:/assets/hidden-cost.png|alt:Hidden
      cost of self hosting|description:)end-custom-image


      Building an infrastructure from scratch means you have to deal with
      security, auto scale, load balance, database backups and much more.


      > Self hosting works great until it doesn’t


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:|src:/assets/self-hosting.gif|alt:What
      it’s like to manage an e-commerce
      infrastructure|description:)end-custom-image


      Shopify on the other hand is a fully hosted solution. That means that it
      runs on an infrastructure entirely managed by Shopify, and you don’t have
      to worry about anything.


      ### Security


      If you are going to sell anything online, you must follow specific
      security standard (namely PCI DSS) to protect your customer payment data
      from being stolen and used in fraud. The reputation of your store is at
      stake. Are your servers compliant with all those security standards? Do
      you meet GDPR requirements if you are selling in EU?


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:undefined|src:/assets/security.gif|alt:Security
      on a discrete amount on self hosted
      application|description:undefined)end-custom-image


      All Shopify application are hosted PCI Compliance Level 1, the maximum
      security level. And they are constantly audited. Using Magento (non cloud)
      you are responsible for the security, and it’s your responsibility to
      apply all the security patches during time.


      > Using Shopify, security is one less thing to worry about.


      ## E-commerce maintenance: Fixing bugs, updating and scaling


      Once you have managed to build and host the e-commerce there is still tons
      of work to do. For example when adding new functionalities or customizing
      existing one there is a good chance of introducing new bugs.


      > The more functionalities your shop has, the more bugs it can have


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:undefined|src:/assets/fix-it.gif|alt:Fix
      it|description:undefined)end-custom-image


      On top of that by using a self managed solution you are responsible for
      installing all the patches and security updates released by Magento,
      paying attention not to break anything in the process.


      start-custom-image(size:tiny|align:center|width:undefined|src:/assets/bugs.png|alt:bugs|description:undefined)end-custom-image


      With Shopify by giving up some flexibility you are gaining freedom from
      dealing with security patches and updates.


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:undefined|src:/assets/update.gif|alt:Updates|description:undefined)end-custom-image


      ## Scaling


      It’s Black Friday weekend, you have just launched a costly advertising
      campaign and users are flooding to your e-commerce. But wait, the servers
      can’t handle all the requests and suddenly everything goes down. If you
      are lucky users will only get an extremely slow and frustrating
      experience, otherwise your e-commerce is no longer reachable.


      start-custom-image(size:small|align:center|width:undefined|src:/assets/fire.gif|alt:Trying
      to scale the servers during traffic
      peak.|description:undefined)end-custom-image


      The risk is that you will be spending more time solving problems about
      scaling than actually scaling.




      > But \[insert big brand name] is using Magento and works fine even during
      Black friday.




      Yes, but they likely have an entire engineering team just dedicated to
      that. Can you afford it?


      Users don’t care about your infrastructure, they want their experience to
      be as pleasant as possible. It’s very difficult to compete against a PaaS
      in term of scalability and therefore you should stop wasting time managing
      your own infrastructure and instead investing your money to provide the
      best user experience possible.


      ## To sum up


      There is a clear tradeoff between flexibility and complexity. The more
      flexible a platform is, the more complex it becomes. If your want to
      invest in Magento because you think it worth it you have to be sure you’ll
      be able to handle the complexity;


      Otherwise the risk is that you will end up wasting most of your time
      dealing with problems not directly related to your business, like managing
      servers and there is a good chance your store is going to quickly
      accumulate technical debt over time, leading to a situation where your
      business is constantly lagging behind competition.




      > While you are spending time figuring out how to scale your
      infrastructure or update to the latest version without breaking everything
      you competitors are implementing new features




      With Shopify you can focus on the important things, like optimizing the
      user experience, leaving all the management of the infrastructure to
      Shopify.




      > A PaaS solution like the one offered by Shopify is stress free.




      ## What about Enterprise?


      At enterprise level the battle is between Magento Commerce and Shopify
      Plus. Things start to become quite expensive (both platforms start at
      $2000/month) and business processes are very different. We are going to
      talk about e-commerce at enterprise level in another post.




      ## Why we choose Shopify


      Shopify fits our clients’ requirements and developers mental sanity.


      Shopify can be summarized with:


      > It just works


      You don’t have to worry about infrastructure, and can invest your time
      working on optimizing the user experience, which in turn let us focus on
      what matters to our customers.


      Maybe Shopify does not offer the same freedom of Magento, but its
      ecosystem won’t make you miss it.


      ## Shopify app store




      ## Shopify is growing fast


      We are not the only one to believe in Shopify. If we look at Google Trends
      we can clearly see Shopify popularity growing while interest in Magento is
      declining.

      Also the markets believe in Shopify business, demonstrating this is the
      stock value that it’s gone from $28 to $350 in less than 5 years.

      ## Conclusion


      We hope that this post has created some food for thoughts about the
      flexibility/complexity tradeoff, and why we choose Shopify over Magento.




      Of course Shopify is not a perfect platform and there are a lot of
      functionalities and improvements we hope to see in the future, but overall
      we believe Shopify approach will become the gold standard of e-commerces.
